# SHARP provenance toolbox
## Synopsis
SHARP is a reasearch prototype aimed at harmonizing heterogeneous provenance graphs through reasoning (PROV inferences). PROV Constraints inferences rules () have been implemented through the JENA forward chaining inference engine. 
## Motivations
Several ontologies have been proposed to extend the multi-purpose PROV-O ontology, such as prov-one, wfprov, taverna-prov. The mutiplication of PROV-extended vocabularies makes it diffuclt to link and cross-exploit multi-systems provenance graphs. In addition, even if workflow management systems produce strictly PROV-O entities, there is no guaranty that the same classes and properties are used, possibly leading to non joinable graphs. 

With SHARP, or objective is to propose reasoning mechanisms to produce harmonized provenance graphs, that can be more easily linked together and queried
